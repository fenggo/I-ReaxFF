# I-ReaxFF: stand for Intelligent-Reactive Force Field

- I-ReaxFF is a differentiable ReaxFF framework based on TensorFlow, with which we can get the first and high order derivatives of energies, and also can optimize **ReaxFF** and **ReaxFF-nn** (Reactive Force Field with Neural Networks) parameters with integrated optimizers in TensorFlow.

* ffield.json: the parameter file from machine learning
* reaxff_nn.lib  the parameter file converted from ffield.json for usage with GULP

## Requirement
 the following package need to be installed
1. TensorFlow, pip install tensorflow --user or conda install tensorflow
2. PyTorch, conda install pyTorch
3. Numpy,pip install numpy --user
4. matplotlib, pip install matplotlib --user

Install this package after download this package and run commond in shell ``` python setup install --user ```. 
Alternatively, this package can be install without download the package through pip
``` pip install --user irff ```.
