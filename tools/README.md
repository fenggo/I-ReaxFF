### Introduction for tools scripts
1. add_layer.py
Add new neural networks to current models, suppose the current parameter file is 'ffield.json', you should make a copy of it named 'ffieldData.json', after running the script by:
```bash
./add_layer.py
``` 
add assuming that the loss is very small, such as 0.001, the parameter file will be 'ffield.json' with new hidden layers with defination.
